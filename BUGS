	I think syslogintr is interfering with RedHats initlog program when
	it is first launched during boot.  It may have something to do with
	iptables, it may not.  I don't know.  Whatever it is, it's a nasty
	bug.

	FIXED - 2010-04-18

	Race condition with syslog() internally and syslog() from another
	process.
