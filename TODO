*	Use poll() instead of epoll()

*	If there are no listening sockets and program wants to relay, 
	create some outbound sockets.  Probably something like:

		syslogintr_host()
		{
		  if (g_ipv4.sock == -1)
		  {
		    create outbound socket
		  }

		  if (g_ipv6.sock == -1)
		  {
		    create outbound socket
		  }
		}
